  Potential Additions (Nice to Have)



  Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
  This will create a self-contained environment for the project's Python dependencies.
   1 python -m venv .venv
   2 source .venv/bin/activate

  Step 2: Install Dependencies
  This will install the required Python packages for the project and its development tools.

   1 pip install -r requirements.txt
   2 pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

  Step 3: Configure Environment
  This will create a .env file from the example, where you can store your local settings.
   1 cp .env.example .env
  You may need to edit the .env file with your specific configuration, but the defaults should work for local development.

  Step 4: Set up the Database
  This will create the database and an admin user.
   1 python manage.py migrate
   2 python manage.py createsuperuser


  Step 5: Create Initial System Settings
  This will create the default system settings required for the application to run.
   1 python manage.py shell -c "from core.security_models import SystemSettings; SystemSettings.get_settings(); exit()"

  Step 6: Start the Development Server
  This will start the Django development server.
   1 python manage.py runserver

  Once the server is running, you can access the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/.
